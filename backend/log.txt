created 2 folders frontend and backend
cd backend
npm init -y // install libraries
created index.js and in it
npm i express mysql nodemon
then added this - "start": "nodemon index.js" in start
write this code
then create a react app in the folder by using "npx create-react-app . "
then write some more code
npm install axios
fix cors issue by installing it in the back end
after a long trouble i did ,
-- Select the database
USE your_database_name;

-- Modify the column in the table
ALTER TABLE your_table_name
MODIFY COLUMN id INT AUTO_INCREMENT;
// just because of this shit it made me waste 2 hours on this
also i did, ALTER TABLE books MODIFY COLUMN cover VARCHAR(255);
